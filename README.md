#RLG
The Robot Learning Gym is a tool to test RL algorithms for robotics tasks a la OpenAI Gym.
The purpose is to evaluate how well the various RL algorithms work by using a standardized and consistent metric.

##Development
Currently, tasks are being built using the MuJoCo simulation environment and some code borrowed from Gym.
There are two tasks:
1. Opening a door (currently does not have a robot in the environment)
2. Lifting a can using a 7 degree-of-freedom robot arm

##Dependencies
OpenAI Gym with MuJoCo Python bindings
MuJoCo
