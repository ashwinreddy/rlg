#RLG: Robot Learning Gym
Robot Learning Gym is a tool to test reinforcement learning algorithms for robotics tasks a la OpenAI's [Universe](https://universe.openai.com/) and/or [Gym](https://gym.openai.com).

The purpose is to evaluate how well various RL algorithms work on robotics (motor/manipulation) tasks by using standardized and consistent metrics.
To do this, RLG supports the ability to easily add robots and tasks in order to evaluate performance on a large repertoire of tasks. This makes it possible to quickly and easily test which conditions algorithms work best and worse under.
