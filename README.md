#RLG
The Robot Learning Gym is a tool to test RL algorithms for robotics tasks a la OpenAI Gym.
The purpose is to evaluate how well the various RL algorithms work by using a standardized and consistent metric.

##Development
Currently, tasks are being built using the MuJoCo simulation environment and some code borrowed from Gym.
